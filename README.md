Student Performance Risk Prediction Model
This project analyzes student performance data to build and evaluate machine learning models that predict whether a student is "at risk" of failing a course. The primary goal is to create an early-warning system that can help educators identify struggling students before their grades suffer, enabling timely intervention.

Methodology
The project uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict student risk. The definition of an "at-risk" student is a final grade (G3) of â‰¤ 9 out of 20. The project explores two distinct models to serve different purposes:

Early-Warning Model: This model uses only non-academic features like demographics, family background, and lifestyle to predict risk. The key insight is that this model can identify at-risk students before their first and second-period grades (G1 and G2) are available.

End-of-Course Model: This model includes all features, including G1 and G2 grades. It serves as a highly accurate benchmark to show the predictive power of early academic performance.

The model was trained and evaluated using a comprehensive pipeline that includes:

Data preprocessing with scaling for numeric features and one-hot encoding for categorical features.

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to find the best model configuration.

Optimization for the F2-score to prioritize recall, which is crucial for an early-warning system where missing an at-risk student (a false negative) is more costly than a false alarm (a false positive).

Fine-tuning of the classification threshold to find a practical balance between precision and recall, reducing alert fatigue for real-world application.

Key Findings
The two models performed as expected, highlighting a critical trade-off between timing and accuracy:

The End-of-Course Model showed very high predictive power (high ROC-AUC and F2-score) because it was trained on G1 and G2 grades, which are strong indicators of final performance. However, this model's predictions come too late for effective intervention.

The Early-Warning Model had lower predictive power but is far more valuable for real-world use. It successfully identifies patterns in non-academic data that are correlated with a student being at risk. By adjusting the prediction threshold, the model was tuned to prioritize a good balance between catching most at-risk students (high recall) and avoiding an excessive number of false alarms (acceptable precision).
